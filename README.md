## What is CortexON?

Under the hood, CortexON integrates multiple specialized agents that dynamically collaborate to accomplish user-defined objectives. These specialized agents include:

- **Web Agent:** Handles real-time internet searches, data retrieval, and web interactions.
- **File Agent:** Manages file operations, organization, data extraction, and storage tasks.
- **Coder Agent:** Generates, debugs, and optimizes code snippets across various programming languages.
- **Executor Agent:** Executes tasks, manages workflows, and orchestrates inter-agent communications.
- **API Agent:** Integrates seamlessly with external services, APIs, and third-party software to extend automation capabilities.

Together, these agents dynamically coordinate, combining their unique capabilities to effectively automate complex tasks.
